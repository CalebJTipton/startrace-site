        <h2>About StarTrace</h2>
        <p>
          The StarTrace project is centered around safeguarding Starlink satellites from jamming attacks. It aims to provide the first publicly-available holistic view of the StarLink satellite network.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals and Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          StarTrace utilizes a machine learning algorithm to analyze satellite signal strength and data in conjunction with weather patterns and topography. This helps assess whether a weak signal is due to a deliberate attack or an external factor.

        <h2>User Interface and Data Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          Users receive assessments through a user interface and can contribute data towards the development of an open-source data repository. This repository aids the project and serves as a resource for similar initiatives.

        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
        <p>
          As a community-driven initiative, StarTrace relies on crowdsourcing to enrich its dataset, empowering participants and enhancing the scope of the project. This approach contributes to a valuable open-source data repository.

        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
          Looking forward, StarTrace aims to initiate projects using its comprehensive data on signal strength, weather, and topography, augmenting the core team's expertise through a primarily software-based design and limited hardware use.
